## Chapter 1 
###Thoughts about this course:
I enjoyed the soft landing on this course. It was comforting to start and go through the very basics. \ 
From this course, I expect to learn to integrate the use of github and R markdown in my daily work. \
I also expect to learn the best practices in open data science. I heard about this course through \ 
the email list of my doctoral program.
