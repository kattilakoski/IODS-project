## Chapter 1 
### Thoughts about this course:
I enjoyed the soft landing on this course. It was comforting to start and go through the very basics.  
From this course, I expect to learn to integrate the use of github and R markdown in my daily work. 
I also expect to learn the best practices in open data science. I heard about this course through  
the email list of my doctoral program.

### Reflections on the learning experience:
So far the book and exercises have been a great crash course to R tools and RStudio.I enjoy the style of writing in the book. My favorite section so far is the chapter 4 focusing on plots. I found it useful.
